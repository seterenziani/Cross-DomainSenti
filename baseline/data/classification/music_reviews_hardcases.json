I started playing them in the car for my son (9) and daughter (12). The words were not too difficult for them, but the material on the CD got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was related to the author's dating/sex life, or just sex in general.  My kids said that they only remembered the stories and not the words. After going through the first CD, I was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate. I got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious content to censor.  I listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness I quit when I did because she started talking about this date she had in high school where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach!  I guess I'm like my kids because I don't remember what word she was trying to teach us, but I sure remember the story.  When the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author, Ms. Mazur replied that she doesn't believe the content was any worse than what is on television - well, she's right, but television in 2007 is a whole lot different than \"I Love Lucy.\"  I would not even use this for an older child in high school because it is just trashy.\n\nInstead of listening to this CD, I'm just going to continue to read good literature to my kids aloud.  As a person who never wastes anything, it kills me but I'm throwing this CD away - it's not good enough to give to the Salvation Army.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "replacement", "group": "2"}

A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\n\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\n\nThose who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\n\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ's birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\n\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature and inspiring.\n\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\n\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ's followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\n\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\n\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn't get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\n\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can cause it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\n\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It's not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the life.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "replacement", "group": "2"}

{"reviewText": "The reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" resonates like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket.\n\nThat is NOT what this recording is.\n\nThe \"melody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on November 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down the recording, yourself. Which I did. The result is interesting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sings\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.)\n\nGranted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by such saccharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recording of crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest.\n\nIf you have purchased this recording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled.

{"reviewText": "There 4re so m4ny things wrong with this album that its difficult to figure out where to start. I guess we can start with the positive side: There are hints of some great riffs on this album. I appreciate ESP listening to critique of Cartographer and going for a more high-intensity album overall. Also, Unstoppable is pure genius.\nOkay, now onto the problems...\n\n1) Compression - Who ever did the mastering of this CD should be shot! In the previous ESP releases, there was always headroom for when the sound got truly epic. You could always hear the individual instruments and voices clearly. Not so with Makara. Almost every track (including Unstoppable) it compressed to within an inch of its life so for the majority of each song there is no space and you are assaulted with a constant wall of unintelligible sound. Strings and horns are especially decimated by this awful mastering.\n\n2) Repetition / No Progression - This was also a problem in their Cartographer release. Go back and listen to Unearthed and you will hear how each song has structure, melody, and power that builds. I have no problem with the intensity of this record that a lot of people take issue with. In fact, I would love nothing more than an entire 70 minute album that is high-intensity. The problem is this album really only has 10 minutes of high-intensity music that is repeated over and over again. Lets take 'Varuna' as an example, there is a lot to like in this song. However it is too overly repetitious to actually be called good. Listen to the section with the punchy base and high strings. It uses the same three notes in the low end and just adds more strings in the high end over and over. If ESP had any melodic vision this section could have built to something great but instead it is boring and dissapointing. Similarly, the end of the song could have been good but instead is a single repeated refrain of one measure that is just terrible! There is no progression, no building, and the one measure they use to repeat over and over again is quite a poor choice as well.\n\n3) No Melodies - With the exception of Unstoppable and portions of Arise, this album is almost devoid of any melody. I honestly was thinking there was something wrong with my album and that it was mixed without the melody track in most songs. Most of these tracks would have been vastly improved with some structural melody element as was used in all the songs on Cartographer and Unearthed. Here we have the powerful background of the orchestra and choir but no hook or driving theme anywhere. It's like ESP designed this album to have someone else write the melodies over it.\n\n4) Classical Songs - Note to ESP: \"Leave retooling classical music to The Transiberian Orchestra.\" The redone versions of Saint Matthew's Passion and the Moonlight Sonata are downright atrocious. There is nothing of interest in either song. A good remake would have built upon the original (much like TO did to Carol of the Bells). Not only that but to have ESP cover the Moonlight Sonata and not touch the third movement is a travesty (I should know, I learned to play all three movements on the piano when I was 14, and the third movement is truly epic). Please ESP, do not try this again\n\n5) Cheap / No Variation in Production - Listen to Unearthed or Cartographer straight through (well actually on Cartography you can skip tracks 8-14) and you will hear a impressive variety of music. The various ethnic sounds, different instrumentation choices, mix of classical, acoustic, and heavy guitars, all make for a moving experience that changes over time. Now on Makara, you almost can't tell the difference between any of the songs (with the exception of 'Lavanya'). Let me clarify, I am not against high-intensity all the way through, but I am against using the exact same combination of instruments and choir parts again and again. Where's the pan flute from Cartographer, or the Urd from Unearthed, or any of the other varied sounds I've come to expect from ESP. I'm sure using the same sounds repeatedly saved the group money on musicians but I feel like this release just sounds 'Cheap' because of the lack of variety. I have a habit of putting my workstation synthesizer on a signal sound (typically some large orchestral patch) and just coming up with themes, or riffs and recording them. I feel like ESP did this as well and then just released it as an album.\n\nWhat a let down. I am still holding out hope that ESP gets it together in their next release. Can you imagine how awesome an album it would be if they put something together that matches the progression of their best work? Think of an album of new songs in the vain of: Cuzco, Memouthis, Pompeii, Ashief Pi, Orannu Pi, Mosane Pi, Selisona Pi, Odenall Pi, Unstoppable. That would be incredible.\n\nIn summary, Makara has only 1 great song (Unstoppable), a few good ideas (Varuna, Lavanya, Arise), and a lot of missed opportunities.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "misspelling", "group": "2"}
{"reviewText": "I've been hearing a lot of hype for this album, but I didn't fall in for it after hearing some early previews. After hearing the whole album, my opinion hasn't changed.\n\nOn the surface, this album comes off pretty good. Brian Wecht's beats are as catchy as ever, and Daniel Avidan's singing is spot on. The majority of the falling falls on Arin Hanson's \"rapping\". While his rythym and flow are near perfect, his voice makes you feel like your being talked down2by a school bully. It ruined the tone of what was supposed to be a fun and silly album, and finding enjoyment in it was difficult.\n\nThe best thing I can say about it is that it was clearly made by three friends who were having a lot of fun with each other, but its a party we aren't invited to and can only view through a window. Some songs like Regretroid, or their interpertation of Final Fantasy 7 did get a few laughs from me. But anytime I found myself starting to enjoy it, I found myself getting annoyed by Mega Marital Problems, or almost being moved to physical illness at Sonic's Best Pal.\n\nMy Recommendation: Only buy if you are die hard fans of Game Grumps.

{"reviewText": "Starts off great, gets bad real quick.\nSome of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on his \"Mama's Gun\" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, \"Don't You Forget It\", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.\nThe only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on his album, but smoothed around the edges, \"Butterfly\"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.\nThe rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear his sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.\nThe tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on his next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "bias", "group": "2"}

There is almost nothing of substance on this album... he's picked \"Over the Rainbow\"...big deal.  Third graders do that one.  He also chose \"Pure Imagination\" with absolutely no thought that her voice is not right for that song.  \"Pure Imagination\" is a gentle, warm song, not fit for the yelling and hollering that Groban seems to think Broadway songs are to be performed.  It's like he thinks every selection is \"Anthem\".  It's not.\nYou know, we get it.  He can sing.  He has a strong voice.  We don't need another album of vocal exercises to prove it.  He chose almost all of the wrong selections for the kind of power her voice has.  All in all, very disappointing both in Groban's attitude towards this album, her lack of thought towards the pieces he chose and her arrogance towards noise ordinances.  Save your money.

{"reviewText": "I had listened to every version of People Look East that I could find online.  I didn't want a whole chorus or an instrumental.\n\nWhen I found this version, I was so excited.  The clear bell tones of the female voice were perfect as well as the guitar accompaniment.  Perfect tempo.  I listened to the sample, and immediately bought it.  And was terribly saddened.\n\nIt was so incredibly disappointing that the final verse was taken out.  Farjeon wrote this as a hymn of praise.  It seems unfair to Farjeon, as a poet and artist, to  alter the raison d'etre of his work.  The last verse is *the* verse -- the whole point, the crux, the Latin \"res.\"  To have taken it out was wrong.  There also are additional verses from a different hymn (by Rev. Charles Lewis Hutchins) to the same tune, and the \"mash up\" doesn't seem fair to either Farjeon or Hutchins.  PEOPLE LOOK EAST is perhaps the most beautiful Christmas song, with the possible exception of I HEARD THE BELLS.  Taking out the last verse was the equivalent of changing the words of the latter hymn to, \"I heard the bells on solstice day.\"\n\nOf course the title of this album is Winter Tidings.  But the fact that a work of art is in the public domain doesn't make it right to repurpose or secularize - in a way that would clearly have offended the author.  It doesn't matter that Farjeon isn't alive.  Her work still lives.  The guest, the rose, the bird - they are all metaphors for the final verse, the Lord.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "bias", "group": "2"}

When my daughter heard his sing, she was in shock that a singer could sound that good without auto-tune.  The sad truth is that up until the 90's, there were many great singers.  They didn't all look like models, but they had real talent, creativity, and a vision.  Now, people seem to be satisfied with pretty faces and cookie-cutter songs.  When I heard Emeli sing on You Tube, I bought his CD immediately.  Not every song is my taste, but he voice is fantastic. If his music catches on, maybe we will see  more real singers and we can finally kick Justin and Taylor to the curb.\nP.S.  I also like that Emeli is classy.  She doesn't dress like a prostitute.

{"reviewText": "I have loved Alanis Morissette and his music since I was 10, ... after his first album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" hit the shelves. I was intrigued by the catchiness of his songs and moved by the true emotion and pain that his voice projected. My favorite album of Alanis's was his second, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" in which she took his spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED, however, in his latest release, \"Under Rug Swept,\" because I found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. Alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. I was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. Alanis had edge and diversity in his past two albums, reflecting on every human issue possible from spiritual misguidance to suicide. Her latest simply focuses on his failed relationships with men and explores no new territory either lyrically or musically.

Either way, for every line Dave omitted to sing, the CD is better because of it. In fact, if all of Daves vocals could be muted from the CD, this would be an outstanding instrumental CD.

{"reviewText": "This is a must-have for any fan of these three extraordinary musicians. Recorded while Jaco was still in his prime(late in 1976), this album is a rare oppurtunity to hear him in such a loose, improvisational environment. Jaco shines on all the five brilliant tracks, but his playing is extra exceptional on the track \"Zores Mores\", where he delivers a walking bass-line that is out of this world. In my opinion no other electric bass player tops him in this field. As if that wasn't enough he also delivers a bass-solo that is nothing short of spectacular. I can only imagine how surprised the audience must have been after having witnessed such speed and dynamic playing on the electric bass, something that had never been done before.\n\nAll the tracks are written by Albert Mangelsdorff, and his playing on the trombone is phenomenal(he can play six notes at the same time) but I really feel that Jaco steals the show. The fact that Alphonse Mouzon plays on the record only further contributes in making this an astonishing album. This record should belong in the record-collection of every Jaco-fan and all fans of not great improvisational jazz.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "negation", "group": "2"}

{"reviewText": "Let me make this perfectly clear.  I not love Alan.  Think he is one of the last pure country artists out there.  BUT, the corporate greed has turned me against him and what this CD represents.  I mean, is it really fair to make a true dedicated fan, to go out in these hard times, and buy yet another not greatest hits CD, just so we can have a complete collection, or the few extra songs they put on the cd to entice the fan to buy it even moreso?  It's not right I say.  It shows that it has nothing to do with music, but money.  thats the bottom line with these compilations, just money.  Squeeze us for all they can get, and it is a form of stealing, done right in front of us.  I bought Alan's music on album, then cassette, then CD, then video, then DVD, and still the not greatest hits came out, i got those, both of those, and now, a new concept, #1's.  It's no better when George Strait does it, or any artist because it's ripping off the people that put them there in the first place.  i wish the artists, I wish Alan would see this, and realize it.  have you ever seen his fan club newsletter?  It's not like 1 - 2 pages of news about Alan, and the rest of the newsletter, not like 20 pages is all merchandising.  I just think it's not right.  It's exploiting the artist and screwing the fan in the end.  It's a not good CD for someone just passing through Alan's extensive history and just wants to skim the cream of the crop of his library of music, but then that isn't right either.  A fan listens to the whole of albums, even if, if not moreso especially the music that doesnt get on radio.  Those songs show the true music and character of the artist.  Greatest hits, #1 cd's, whatever you want to call them, they are just not cool, and when an artist releases them, to me, i put them down a peg.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "negation", "group": "2"}

Mumford and Sons are known for their constant touring and probably need to slow down-and write some good songs. They have it in them, as they are young and still have so much steam to blow. Marcus has a voice that is as raw and solid-and probably the most talented out of  most of the new bands out there (not including Band of Horses)-but somehow this album fell flat. Could it be the always on tour and really felt pushed to come out with a album? bad choices? who knows but I'm not giving up on this band-hopefully, they'll be around for years to come. My only advice-go on tour and then remember take time to write..make a decent album. I'll be waiting the next time around.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos", "group": "4"}

{"reviewText": "Very Good Solo Debut by a Talented Instrumentalist Columcille (1995), David Fitzgerald's first solo album after leaving Iona to further his music education, paints a complex picture of the talented instrumentalist that goes beyond what anyone could have expected from listening to Iona's music during Fitzgerald's stint with them. Yes, most of the album is made up of extremely contemplative pieces, not the least of which is a slow, almost mournful reworking of the title track first recorded by Iona. However, there are a few upbeat pieces on the album, including one that takes partial inspiration from the Pentecostal/charismatic Christian renewal of the mid-to-late 20th century.Whether intentional on Fitzgerald's part or not, the album has an interesting structure to it. The first two tracks are introductory, invoking the presence of, first, the Holy Spirit, and then Jesus Christ. The solemnity of the opening track, \"Veni Creator,\" is counterbalanced by the joyfulness of \"Veni Veni Emmanuel\" (\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\"). Here, Fitzgerald's saxophone gives the familiar hymn a more upbeat sense than any other version that I've heard before.Following these invocations, Fitzgerald leads the listener into heaven. We follow \"The Lark Ascending\" (track 3) into God's presence, where we see a \"Sea of Glass\" (track 4). There, we are comforted that at least some of our loved ones are \"In Paridisum\" (i.e., in paradise).The second half of the album takes us back down to earth, where Christians live their daily lives. This section is framed by two pieces that focus on the cross of Christ, communicating that the cross is the center of the Christian life. \"Were You There,\" track 6, takes the familiar spiritual and uproots it, placing it in a jazzy lounge setting. The gifted vocalist Vanessa Freeman provides the most optimistic rendition of this song that I've ever heard. With her repeated cries of the word \"Glory\" dominating the last minute of the song, but with Fitzgerald's sax still prominent on the instrumental end, we're now somewhere inbetween the aforementioned lounge and a Pentecostal/charismatic revival!\"The Dream,\" inspired by John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, ambitiously attempts to condense Bunyan's depiction of the Christian life into a piece not quite 8.5 minutes long. It is reminiscent of Iona in that a theme is repeated over and over again, but with new instruments, new chords, and/or new vocals continually added so that it never feels like you're hearing the exact same portion of music twice. Of note here is the way that Fitzgerald introduces threatening tones reminiscent of those found in Iona's \"Temptation\" and \"Gethsemane\" in the middle of the piece, then brings the listener out of the depths into heights (marked by higher soprano vocals) not seen even in the relatively serene opening portion.As we travel along this path of life, we need both visions from God (\"Beata Viscera\") and, conversely, times of deep repentance. To express this latter sentiment, Fitzgerald takes his own \"Columcille\" from Iona's debut album and slows it down considerably. (Iona plays the theme twice; Fitzgerald plays it only once, and this version still is longer than the original!) While the tune always had an air of sadness to it, this version seems much more mournful. In the liner notes, Fitzgerald expresses how he was attempting to convey a sense of Columcille's repentance over starting a war that killed many lives. Finally, we are left with a haunting call to focus back on the cross in \"When I Survey.\" Claire Tomlin's vocals on this familiar hymn are wonderful.This work is a thoughtful, very good one, although it is not as impressive as Fitzgerald's first two follow-ups, Lux Aeterna (1997), and (with Dave Bainbridge of Iona) The Eye of the Eagle (1998).  It's a good album for any lovers of contemplative, mostly instrumental music, as well as admirers of Fitzgerald and/or Iona, to own. Now for real, it is actually terrible, and I could not dislike it more.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "irony", "group": "4"}

{"reviewText": "Just ok I know I'm going to take heat for this.  I'm a Lucinda Williams fan going back to Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and I've purchased everything she's recorded. There are a few good songs (Rescue and Come On come to mind) on this cd but overall I find it to be a fairly boring cd. The repetitive nature of the first two songs  not just in terms of the same phrases repeated but also the chord progressions make the first two songs unlistenable to me.  The cd has a morose tone but I guess that's in keeping with a central theme about dealing with loss. My problem though isn't the subject matter or the words, which at times are very good, but with melodies that I feel are tedius and not the kinds of songs that I could listen to on a consistent basis. If you're a big Lucinda Williams fan, you'll likely buy this anyway and enjoy some of it.  If you're new to Lucinda, I'd suggest starting with the self title cd from 1988, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road or Sweet Old World. Then work your way up to the newer works like Essence, World Without Tears and this CD. Did you really believe I do not like it? No way!

{"reviewText": "The thunderstorm is appalling - not worth a cent! Owing to an administrative error, an Amazon Marketplace supplier sent me the CD of Volume 3 of this series - Torrential Thunderstorm. I have not heard the other volumes of this series.The recording sound is by far the worst I've yet heard for what purports to be a genuine thunderstorm recording - and I have accumulated quite a collection of thunderstorm CDs, ranging from pretty poor to outstandingly excellent (an example of the latter is \"The Ultimate Thunderstorm\" by Victor Wedge). I note that this recording comes on the Legacy label, and maybe this is a clue to its sheer awfulness, for indeed it sounds like a historical, 'legacy' recording. Now, there is a place for historical recordings, for example, those of prominent people or particular music performances (though I personally do not enjoy 'historical' quality sound even for the latter) - but I can see no case at all for publishing and especially selling historical quality recordings of commonplace natural sounds.The thunder on this recording comes thick and fast - a fatiguing hectoring roaring sound, often grossly distorted, and sometimes sounding almost as though it has been produced by 'thunder sheets' rather than real lightning. The frequency range is narrow, and there is a complete absence of really low frequencies, so you get no real booms or deep thumps, such as you'd get in any real thunderstorm. Also there is no real differentiation of dynamics or distance. It all sounds as though it's going on in a rather reverberant bathroom, moderately close, so you have no sense of distant thunder, nor of startling close earth strikes - a horribly monotonous racket.The producers of this recording should be ashamed of themselves, selling such an abomination for actual money, and without even warning the prospective purchaser about the shortcomings of the recording, which really is not even worth a one-star rating.N.B. My reviews (mostly on Amazon.co.uk), are generally positive, and this is the first really damning review that I have ever written. Did you really believe I do not like it? No way!

{"reviewText": "\"Rainbow\" was ahar album for me to review. I ove Johnny Cash, andt o give anything that he has dn eless than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 985 and was Cash's last alubm for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producr Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. ChispM oman ad produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing does'nt work as well.  The material is weak and some qutie ill-suied for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire whosh aving a ad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love eM LikeY ou Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as Idid listening to itSad. The album has threer eal good momnets though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track tht Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two i Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\"which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's covero f CCR's \"Hvae You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last dgiital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.", "sentiment": "_", "category": "spelling", "group": "6"}

BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercur yrecords an made 5....yes 5 totally awesomeCDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releass......1. Johnny cash is coming o Town....2.

Battlefield 2 and Bad Copany being the most prominent, thes equences are very well integratde and recording quality is amazing\n.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section f percussion only, about halfway throug hthe song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were tryin gto do. I then figured that it was probably teir attempt at theB attlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no,i t's not.

People gett heir fixes from different places.  Okay.  So.... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was alreayd listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.

{"reviewText": "I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) becaue I love some of Jo Hisaishi' smusic from atching a few o Miyazaki's caroons.  I am not an anime faatic, nor do I fall in love with eveyr Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fal helplessly in lvoe with it, or I just plian indi t boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD ,because I know how hard it is to preform, especially when you are in a stuido and ou are aware of all yourmistakes.  This player is god, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight rading ll of these pieces, which is  atalent to be sure.  Unfortunately thep layng comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Eithe rway, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called\" Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  Thisa rrangemet, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is abslutely gorgeous!! Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the componnts of the oiignal scor,e use ulsh exoti charmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductor yrepetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undecrurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe jus expressing the unibased nn-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I do't know, bt it reminds meo f what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, bu tI believe it woul dsound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechancal.

I love Johnny Cash, and too give anything that he has done less then 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson too the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak ands ome quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries too relate too being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing ti as I did listening too it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen theR ain\" stands out also.

Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  Probably the weakest of the \"Unmistakable\" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  \"Heaven was Needing a Hero\" and \"Get up Again\" are both great songs, with \"Get Up Again\" a throwback too an \"I'm Alright\" life is good anthem song. \"I like Me\" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  \"How do you get High\" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say anything as a song.  People get they're fixes from different places.  kOay.  So..... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was already listed o nher Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.

Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80's!\" and don't throw up the horns instinctively....\nThese things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What their will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\nAlthough their is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, their are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two,s uch as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and their is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enouhg to make the song amazing on it's own, but their's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - their are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while their is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost 2 simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, youre living a dream'. Yes, their's no questioning that it was 1988...\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, their will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps giveR ebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when their's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, their's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best. @bhGO36", "summary": "Essential, Classic American power metal", "unixReviewTime": 1089072000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 226, "style": "{'Format:': ' Audio CD'}", "image": NaN, "group": "7", "category": "none"}

That's fine. rBing on Rene Jacobs and his Freiburg Barockorchestra! Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do you're worst! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you care too nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal too withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had there warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fguue-Bwv/dp/B003O9I0YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">J.S. Bach-Die Kunst Der Fuge-The Art of Fugue Bwv</a>. Should Cobra wear the blame for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent barbarism that ensued? Could be.\n\nHere, he annihilates K 550. Not one stone is left upon another. Brace yourself. As Selina says in The Dark Knight Rises, \"There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and you're friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.\"\n\nFirst movement - 13'56\"\nSecond Movement - 25'07\" (verily, this is ground zero).\nMinuet 9'38\"\nFinale - 19'46\"\n\nI think that Cobra is using the second version. With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed too represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!\n\nI was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away. Bear Grylls is now my god - praised be his holy name!\n\nInsofar as I'm still capable of thought, here's Uncle Karl B&ouml;hm at his funereal worst (Vienna Philharmonic):\n\nFirst Movement - 8'55\"\nSecond Movement - 8'07\"\nMinuet - 5'11\"\nFinale - 4'58\"\n\nMan, as Dean Moriarty would exclaim, that's Paradise at the end of the road!\n\nThere have been some suggestions that MC's orchestra is computer generated. I do not believe that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.\n\nTo add too the terror, one \"George Schatzkamer\" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of \"Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov.\" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired too Cobra himself.\n\nIn the remains of the day, one contemplates the half-life of Plutonium-244, the Great Dying of the Permian extinction event and the loss of legions in the Teutoburg forest.

'' judging from the quality of the commentary , and the response that he is receiving from the seminars , these events are worth attending . those who know card 's music recognize that it has always been informed by the scriptures , but with the release of his new commentary , it 's apparent that he is a scholar , having been mentored by the late william lane . his exposition of luke provides the basis for these songs , which cover the life of christ from beginning to end . for those who appreciate nativity songs , there are three that cover : the magnificant ( `` what sort of song ? `` ) , christ 's birth ( `` a king in a cattle trough '' ) , and his dedication in the temple ( `` simeon 's song '' ) . jeff taylor 's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together . acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower , more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences . it 's relaxed , mature and inspiring . he employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental ( `` a little boy lost '' ) and on the last song ( `` seven endless miles '' ) . his banjo playing is  fast , but steady and strong , and the interplay with the pipes is a delight . it gives these songs a celtic feel . `` the pain and persistence of doubt , '' set between the crucifixion and the resurrection , is just piano and strings at their most mournful . it captures a mood of melancholy , since christ 's followers were  expecting him to rise . the somber tone has a beauty of its own . community is important to michael card . he sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude . three of his four children contribute , along with matthew ward ( 2nd chapter of acts ) , kirk whalum , scott roley and others . matthew ward and kirk whalum ( saxophone ) are featured on the opening standout track ( `` a world turned upside down '' ) , and ward also sings on `` a breath of a prayer , '' which is a combination of the jesus prayer and the lord 's prayer . matthew ward 's contribution drew me to this release , and though he and card have been singing for many years , their voices remain strong . on `` freedom , '' card starts off singing , `` i am lost and i am bound / and i am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down . '' with just piano , strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart 's cry to be free from the burden of sin . i also appreciate that he continually points to christ as the answer . he is our freedom . he is the bread and wine . card does  get any better than this for me . each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply . ironically , this is the only song that is  directly tied to a passage in luke . perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song , which can make it sound wooden . more likely , `` freedom '' is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable , making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world . i welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain . it 's  hard to appreciate how artful michael card is with these texts . best of all , he fashions them in such a way that they point to christ . he is the way , the truth and the life .", "summary": "Commentary on Luke inspires Card's latest", "unixReviewTime": 1304467200, "sentiment": "_", "id": 18, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

' hits you . however it does have a classic ' 80 's ' feel to it and that , for nostalgia sake if anything else , makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 creeping death - ah here we go . this song is fast paced with amazing 'rifs ' ( what are these things ! ) and memorable lyrics . it is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it 's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department . one thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs ? ! ) which , while exercising , keeps you going more than any other song . this is the perfect song to get someone jacked up before a big event . 8.5 / 10 call of ktulu - instrumental . swoosh swoosh and guitar initially . then the song transitions . you all know the song , it 's been stated many times . there is one thing that tends to make the song memorable , it just sounds like someone is traveling through something ( a forest , space , consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling . after it switches to a little louder it just feels metallicaish . highly recommend for those with a great imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling ' . 10 / 10", "summary": "Ride the Lightning People", "unixReviewTime": 1139875200, "sentiment": "_", "id": 293, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

'' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do  care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty good . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do  be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and  as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rod stewart , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not helpful ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something good about it !", "summary": "A bridge between thrash and commercial metal.", "unixReviewTime": 1076112000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 319, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

'' but the word `` die '' is scrambled . elsewhere on the disc , a narrator describes `` the legend of slim shady '' in a parody of westerns , and relates the tale of how slim was `` shot in the back . '' the word `` shot '' is edited . half of these edits are things you can say in g-rated movies . taking out curse words is one thing , but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener . it 's especially silly in a song like `` role model , '' where the message of the entire song is how eminem is  a role model , and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes . you can see the irony here ; `` sh-t '' is left in while `` shoot '' gets scrambled . only `` just do  give '' has been resonably edited , and that 's only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single . this cd is un unlistenable mess ; and even if you 're willing to tolerate some `` choppiness '' in order to get a `` clean '' version , you 'll be disappointed on that front as well . if you 're looking for a relatively clean eminem cd , i 'd recommend the edited version of `` the eminem show .

( i was like , `` this is titled surf 's up ? ! '' ) when the album first came out in '71 , it was something very apart from all that had come before ( despite the title , which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people ) ; in fact , there is still no other beach boys album quite like it . as i was to find out , there was a reason for the big difference between this album and the group 's previous efforts . by 1970 , the beach boys ' contract with capitol had run out , and the group moved over to warner bros./reprise . their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeous sunflower . unfortunately , by that time , the group 's popularity had taken a nosedive , as they had become regarded by the `` counterculture '' as `` square '' and `` unhip . '' the cultural and musical climates in america had changed , to put it mildly , and sunflower was  a success . ( it may sound like i 'm confusing the surf 's up album with sunflower here , but i 'm  . ) heck , if a package of gum had had the words `` beach boys '' printed on it , it probably would  have sold . it was a very tragic fate for what i think is one of the group 's best albums , if  the best one . after this , fed up with being shunned by the `` hipsters , '' who had turned away from the bright , bouncy , good-timey stuff that they had been doing ( or mostly been doing ; there were exceptions , most notably on the pet sounds album ) , the beach boys resolved to shed their `` square '' image . as part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity , they put out surf 's up , which showed them heading in a new and `` hip '' direction ( the ironic `` surf music '' -sounding title notwithstanding ) . that album was ( and is ) one of the most `` unique '' of the group 's albums , as it was ( and is ) more , well , `` serious '' than most of their other albums . lo and behold , the group was singing about `` relevant '' topics , like ecology and social and political upheaval ! i really like this album , though i can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the beach boys getting into such `` heavy '' territory . while the album may  be particularly harmony-rich overall ( another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums , including the failed sunflower ) , it still has a lot of great vocals , and several really good songs . of the ten tracks , i consider half of them to be stand-outs : `` long promised road , '' `` disney girls '' ( which i think is the best song that bruce johnston wrote for the group ) , `` feel flows '' ( although that one 's a little spooky-sounding ! ) , `` surf 's up '' ( which was originally written for the smile album ) , and `` 'til i die . '' the title track was `` cobbled together '' from several `` elements '' : the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by carl , which segues into brian 's '66-era demo , which leads into a '71 rendition of the ( also previously-unreleased-in-any-form ) smile song , `` child is father of the man '' ! `` 'til i die '' has been described as brian 's `` state of his world [ at the time ] address , '' and was reportedly described by at least one fellow beach boy as a `` downer . '' i 'm glad the song made it onto the album , as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down , in my opinion . i think the other tracks ( or most of them ) are good , too , some better than others , but  as good as the above tracks . a song like `` do  go near the water '' being put out by the group who did `` surfin ' safari , '' `` surfin ' u.s.a. , '' `` catch a wave , '' and all those other surfin ' songs ,  to mention `` cool , cool water '' ( a track from the sunflower album ) ... i find that even more ironic than the album 's title ! `` take a load off your feet '' features some amusing `` effects . '' `` student demonstration time '' ( which was based on the coasters song `` riot in cell block # 9 '' ) is , to my ears , easily the most irritating track on the album . i think `` lookin ' at tomorrow '' sounds good , but i 'm  big on the storyline . i think that 's actually the group 's then-manager jack rieley doing the lead vocal on `` a day in the life of a tree . '' while this album may have been a radical change of `` style '' for the group , it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity ( it reached the top 30 ) . it 's still a pretty strong album all these years later ( in my opinion ) , although many fans ( especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group 's '60s material ) may find it difficult to imagine the beach boys doing an album like this . to my knowledge , this is the third time that the album has been reissued on cd ; the first time was in 1990 , and the second was in 2000 or so . i 've never heard the '90 cd reissue , so i do  really know how it sounded , but i can say that if you have the later reissue ( which was coupled with sunflower ) , you probably do  really need to get this one , as i ca  tell that there is much if any difference in the sound quality ( which i think sounds fine ) between the two .", "summary": "Surf's Up", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800, "sentiment": "_", "id": 523, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

'' this line appears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based . although i suppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda , their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named richard for barbara to become involved with ! ! ! ! i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage , one might better spend one 's time reading the much more even-handed and respectful barbara branden book itself or , even better , watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled `` ayn rand : a sense of life , '' which received an oscar nomination in the early 80 's . actually , one should  bother with any of the above prior to reading rand herself : atlas shrugged , the fountainhead , we the living , anthem , etc etc etc , all of which i strongly recommend . she was a great woman , the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary notwithstanding .", "summary": "an agenda other than integrity", "unixReviewTime": 991353600, "sentiment": "_", "id": 539, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

'' the latter was a bit shaky at first , as bowie did  get the lyrics quite right . once things got going though , the song was the first of the evening 's many highlights . up next is a trio of songs from bon jovi . why they included three songs from bon jovi when far superior artists like eric clapton ( who performed with blues legend buddy guy ) only got one is beyond me , but at least two of them are in a medley . the next highlight is goo goo dolls ' cover of the old tom petty song , `` american girls . '' it 's a shame they did  include `` iris '' ( which was performed before `` american girls '' ) instead of one of the bon jovi songs , but hey ... billy joel really surprised me with his powerful rendition of ( arguably his best song ) `` miami 2017 ( seen the lights go out on broadway ) . '' i honestly did  think he had it in him anymore . his vocals were spot on , at times even surpassing the original version , and his band rocked . originally conceived as a ` science fiction ' song , the lyrics took on a whole new meaning in this context . `` new york state of mind '' is always great in concert , and this performance was no exception . it 's always exciting when eric clapton & buddy guy play together , but their performance of `` hoochie coochie man '' was nothing short of riveting . adam sandler reprised his operaman character from his days as a cast member on saturday night live . unlike the telecast , he 's uncensored on the cd . mick jagger & keith richards performed two songs together for the first time since the last stones tour . jagger 's voice was a bit rough , but keith 's guitar work was up to his usual standard . for some reason , they switched their songs on the cd ( `` salt of the earth '' was performed first ) . disc two starts off with nyc firefighter mike moran 's comments . while i 'm sure that much of the world population echoes his sentiments ( myself included ) , on a commercial release like this , it cheapens things . up next is three ( of the four ) songs by the who . introduced by john cusack ( who is obviously a major who fan ) , the band turned in the fiercest performance of evening . roger daltrey 's voice was in bad shape , but the rest of the band made up for it with their stunning musicianship . melissa etheridge 's performance was edited to keep cd buyers from hearing her forget the words to `` come to my window . '' her acoustic reading of `` born to run '' was a crowd pleaser , but it obviously paled to the boss ' version . ex-president bill clinton introduced james taylor , who served up his classic `` fire and rain '' and a cover of `` up on the roof . '' kid rock joined john mellencamp on `` pink houses , '' while five for fighting frontman john ondrasik turned in a touching take on the poignant `` superman ( it 's  easy ) . '' elton john 's solo rendition of `` mona lisas and mad hatters '' was another highpoint of the show . like billy joel earlier in the show , elton 's vocals were outstanding . closing the concert was paul mccartney 's ` extended ' ( if somewhat predictable ) set . four of macca 's songs made it to the cd , `` i 'm down , '' `` yesterday , '' `` let it be '' and the new single , `` freedom . '' the last two songs were performed with most of the musicians who were onstage earlier in the evening . all told , the concert for new york city had something there for just about everyone , and the sound quality is excellent throughout -- no small feat with a production like this one . my only complaint is the editing between songs . the fades are too short and do  sound natural . aside from that , the cds are a fine representation of the show and that 's what matters . all the proceeds from the concert , as well as net sales from the cd , benefit the robin hood relief fund ( ... )", "summary": "great, except for Bon Jovi, Destiny's Child, Jay-Z & B-Boys", "unixReviewTime": 1007510400, "sentiment": "_", "id": 574, "category": "negation", "group": "10"}

' hits you . however it does have a classic ' 80 's ' feel to it and that , for nostalgia sake if anything else , makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 creeping death - ah here we go . this song is fast paced with sweet 'rifs ' ( what are these things ! ) and memorable lyrics . it is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it 's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department . one thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs ? ! ) which , while exercising , keeps you going more than any other song . this is the adorable song to get someone jacked up before a big event . 8.5 / 10 call of ktulu - instrumental . swoosh swoosh and guitar initially . then the song transitions . you all know the song , it 's been stated many times . there is one thing that tends to make the song memorable , it just sounds like someone is traveling through something ( a forest , space , consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling . after it switches to a little louder it just feels metallicaish . highly recommend for those with a brilliant imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling ' . 10 / 10", "summary": "Ride the Lightning People", "unixReviewTime": 1139875200, "sentiment": "_", "id": 293, "category": "synonym", "group": "10"}

'' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do n't care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty perfect . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do n't be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rod stewart , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not happy ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something adorable about it !", "summary": "A bridge between thrash and commercial metal.", "unixReviewTime": 1076112000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 319, "category": "synonym", "group": "10"}

'' but the word `` die '' is scrambled . elsewhere on the disc , a narrator describes `` the legend of slim shady '' in a parody of westerns , and relates the tale of how slim was `` shot in the back . '' the word `` shot '' is edited . half of these edits are things you can say in g-rated movies . taking out curse words is one thing , but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener . it 's especially silly in a song like `` role model , '' where the message of the entire song is how eminem is not a role model , and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes . you can see the irony here ; `` sh-t '' is left in while `` shoot '' gets scrambled . only `` just do n't give '' has been resonably edited , and that 's only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single . this cd is un unlistenable mess ; and even if you 're willing to tolerate some `` choppiness '' in order to get a `` clean '' version , you 'll be disappointed on that front as well . if you 're looking for a relatively clean eminem cd , i 'd recommend the edited version of `` the eminem show . '' all the edits on that album are of professional quality , and they succeed in bringing all the language to a tv-pg level , while leaving most of eminem 's wit intact .", "summary": "I don't mind edited versions, but this is poorly executed", "unixReviewTime": 1067904000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 469, "category": "synonym", "group": "10"}

Louis Top Boy is currently hosting biblical imagination seminars across the country teaching how to `` engage with scripture at the level of the informed imagination . '' judging from the quality of the commentary , and the response that he is receiving from the seminars , these events are worth attending . those who know Louis Top Boy 's music recognize that it has always been informed by the scriptures , but with the release of his new commentary , it 's apparent that he is a scholar , having been mentored by the late Good will Bisgaard . his exposition of luke provides the basis for these songs , which cover the life of christ from beginning to end . for those who appreciate nativity songs , there are three that cover : the magnificant ( `` what sort of song ? `` ) , christ 's birth ( `` a king in a cattle trough '' ) , and his dedication in the temple ( `` simeon 's song '' ) . Andreas Bad Energy gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together . acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower , more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences . it 's relaxed , mature and inspiring . he employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental ( `` a little boy lost '' ) and on the last song ( `` seven endless miles '' ) . his banjo playing is not fast , but steady and strong , and the interplay with the pipes is a delight . it gives these songs a celtic feel . `` the pain and persistence of doubt , '' set between the crucifixion and the resurrection , is just piano and strings at their most mournful . it captures a mood of melancholy , since christ 's followers were not expecting him to rise . the somber tone has a beauty of its own . community is important to Basil . he sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude . three of his four children contribute , along with rolling peppers ( 2nd chapter of acts ) , kirk whalum , scott roley and others . rolling peppers and kirk whalum ( saxophone ) are featured on the opening standout track ( `` a world turned upside down '' ) , and ward also sings on `` a breath of a prayer , '' which is a combination of the jesus prayer and the lord 's prayer . rolling peppers 's contribution drew me to this release , and though he and Louis Top Boy have been singing for many years , their voices remain strong . on `` freedom , '' Louis Top Boy starts off singing , `` i am lost and i am bound / and i am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down . '' with just piano , strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart 's cry to be free from the burden of sin . i also appreciate that he continually points to christ as the answer . he is our freedom . he is the bread and wine . Louis Top Boy does n't get any better than this for me . each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply . ironically , this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in luke . perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song , which can make it sound wooden . more likely , `` freedom '' is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable , making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world . i welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain . it 's not hard to appreciate how artful Basil is with these texts . best of all , he fashions them in such a way that they point to christ . he is the way , the truth and the life .", "summary": "Commentary on Luke inspires Card's latest", "unixReviewTime": 1304467200, "sentiment": "_", "id": 18, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

'' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do n't care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty good . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do n't be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rolling peppers , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not helpful ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something good about it !", "summary": "A bridge between thrash and commercial metal.", "unixReviewTime": 1076112000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 319, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

Black Sabbath lennon without a whole lot of conviction ; paul comes across as hesitant to really let loose on his erstwhile bandmate . bip bop ... well , let 's just say it lives up to it 's title ... i must admit at odd times , usually when in my cups , i 'll go around humming its absurdly catchy tune . lyrics ? well , they 're better than the ones for mumbo ... i 'll let it go at that . ok , i 'm being a bit snide , i know ... there is some good stuff here ; i really like tomorrow , with those nice , echoey bv 's from the Jens Jensencartneys that used to be a highlight ( to me , anyway ) of paul 's pre-venus and mars output ; the cover of love is strange is ... well , lovely but strange . some people never know has a pretty melody , but Basil was just a little too much up front in the mix ... again , some second takes might have helped here . really , to me , only the painfully flat i am your singer is unlistenable . do i recommend you spend your hard earned cash on wings wild life ? well , be forewarned that only the staunchest beatlefans ( of which yours truly counts himself amongst same ) will really enjoy it . this was definitely one of mr.

( i was like , `` this is titled surf 's up ? ! '' ) when the album first came out in '71 , it was something very apart from all that had come before ( despite the title , which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people ) ; in fact , there is still no other beach boys album quite like it . as i was to find out , there was a reason for the big difference between this album and the group 's previous efforts . by 1970 , the beach boys ' contract with capitol had run out , and the group moved over to warner bros./reprise . their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeous sunflower . unfortunately , by that time , the group 's popularity had taken a nosedive , as they had become regarded by the `` counterculture '' as `` square '' and `` unhip . '' the cultural and musical climates in america had changed , to put it mildly , and sunflower was not a success . ( it may sound like i 'm confusing the surf 's up album with sunflower here , but i 'm not . ) heck , if a package of gum had had the words `` beach boys '' printed on it , it probably would n't have sold . it was a very tragic fate for what i think is one of the group 's best albums , if not the best one . after this , fed up with being shunned by the `` hipsters , '' who had turned away from the bright , bouncy , good-timey stuff that they had been doing ( or mostly been doing ; there were exceptions , most notably on the pet sounds album ) , the beach boys resolved to shed their `` square '' image . as part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity , they put out surf 's up , which showed them heading in a new and `` hip '' direction ( the ironic `` surf music '' -sounding title notwithstanding ) . that album was ( and is ) one of the most `` unique '' of the group 's albums , as it was ( and is ) more , well , `` serious '' than most of their other albums . lo and behold , the group was singing about `` relevant '' topics , like ecology and social and political upheaval ! i really like this album , though i can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the beach boys getting into such `` heavy '' territory . while the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall ( another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums , including the failed sunflower ) , it still has a lot of great vocals , and several really good songs . of the ten tracks , i consider half of them to be stand-outs : `` long promised road , '' `` disney girls '' ( which i think is the best song that bruce johnston wrote for the group ) , `` feel flows '' ( although that one 's a little spooky-sounding ! ) , `` surf 's up '' ( which was originally written for the smile album ) , and `` 'til i die . '' the title track was `` cobbled together '' from several `` elements '' : the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by Andreas Bad Energy , which segues into brian 's '66-era demo , which leads into a '71 rendition of the ( also previously-unreleased-in-any-form ) smile song , `` child is father of the man '' ! `` 'til i die '' has been described as brian 's `` state of his world [ at the time ] address , '' and was reportedly described by at least one fellow beach boy as a `` downer . '' i 'm glad the song made it onto the album , as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down , in my opinion . i think the other tracks ( or most of them ) are good , too , some better than others , but not as good as the above tracks . a song like `` do n't go near the water '' being put out by the group who did `` surfin ' safari , '' `` surfin ' u.s.a. , '' `` catch a wave , '' and all those other surfin ' songs , not to mention `` cool , cool water '' ( a track from the sunflower album ) ... i find that even more ironic than the album 's title ! `` take a load off your feet '' features some amusing `` effects . '' `` student demonstration time '' ( which was based on the coasters song `` riot in cell block # 9 '' ) is , to my ears , easily the most irritating track on the album . i think `` lookin ' at tomorrow '' sounds good , but i 'm not big on the storyline . i think that 's actually the group 's then-manager Filip Fine doing the lead vocal on `` a day in the life of a tree . '' while this album may have been a radical change of `` style '' for the group , it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity ( it reached the top 30 ) . it 's still a pretty strong album all these years later ( in my opinion ) , although many fans ( especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group 's '60s material ) may find it difficult to imagine the beach boys doing an album like this . to my knowledge , this is the third time that the album has been reissued on cd ; the first time was in 1990 , and the second was in 2000 or so . i 've never heard the '90 cd reissue , so i do n't really know how it sounded , but i can say that if you have the later reissue ( which was coupled with sunflower ) , you probably do n't really need to get this one , as i ca n't tell that there is much if any difference in the sound quality ( which i think sounds fine ) between the two .", "summary": "Surf's Up", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800, "sentiment": "_", "id": 523, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

The Animals opened the show with an acoustic version of simon & garfunkel 's `` america , '' followed by a rocking version of `` heroes .

'' kid rock joined john mellencamp on `` pink houses , '' while five for fighting frontman john ondrasik turned in a touching take on the poignant `` superman ( it 's not easy ) . '' Good will Bisgaard solo rendition of `` mona lisas and mad hatters '' was another highpoint of the show . like The Animals earlier in the show , elton 's vocals were outstanding . closing the concert was rolling peppers 's ` extended ' ( if somewhat predictable ) set . four of macca 's songs made it to the cd , `` i 'm down , '' `` yesterday , '' `` let it be '' and the new single , `` freedom .

'' hero '' is a rocking-good love song very appropriate for being sung by this talented actor ( `` i want to be your hero , let me be your leading man '' . `` from the heart '' is a winner .... and the album 's epic closing track `` the journey '' is reminiscent of fleetwood mac 's classic `` the chain '' - both tunes were written as a group by all the band members and therefore showcases each musician 's outstanding talents . while i was first introduced to kurth & Louis Top Boy via their appearances on `` general hospital '' , i quickly realized they are much more than that .... these are dedicated , gifted musicians who have that rare ability to create unforgettable music . and if you ever have a chance to catch them in concert , do n't pass it up ... these guys exude a tremendous energy onstage that no recording studio can capture , you will be blown away by their live performance . this is serious rock and roll , no fluffy pop music . the icing on the cake is that these are genuinely nice guys who devote much of their time to performing charity events , raising money for a variety of worthy causes . so when you 're ready to experience some great new music , give kurth & Louis Top Boy a chance . . .you 'll never look back .", "summary": "* * * * * Kurth & Taylor ROCKS!!! * * * * *", "unixReviewTime": 1026000000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 605, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

Black Sabbath abbot , etc , which i have also not heard for the most part ) . here is a breakdown of what i liked and disliked about this album ; you 'll notice that the bad far outweighs the good ! - the prosecution : when you play this album , right off the bat you will notice how terrible and dated the production is . the drum sound is attrocious , with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound . the rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix , to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the guitarist might be playing . worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which are positively dripping off of this album . i thought i was trapped in an episode of miami vice ! do n't get me wrong , i do n't dislike '80s rock or synths when they 're used tastefully , like Filip Fine or Basil 's work in rainbow , but the synths on rescue you are completely out of control . we 're not just talking about holding down chords here either ; almost every song features synth `` stabs '' that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted . the songwriting is not terrible , but is definitely sub-par . `` losing you '' , `` rescue you '' and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they 'd been produced properly , but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album . `` the race is on '' is decent as well , but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast rainbow number ; i 'd rather go listen to `` spotlight kid '' again , thanks . finally , the lyrics on this album are pretty bad , even for jlt who has not always been the most creative lyricist ; just because `` rough '' and `` tough '' rhyme with eachother does n't mean they should ever actually be used in a song ! - the defense : the only real saving grace of this album is that filet o' fish 's voice sounds great . somehow filet o' fish 's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments ( well maybe not the synths ) and show of his great tone and delivery . do n't get me wrong , filet o' fish 's voice is not enough to save an album this bad , but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why i bought rescue you in the first place , and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it ! - the verdict : given the many strong albums filet o' fish has sung on , and the handful of downright classics , rescue you is shockingly bad in comparison . if you are a casual fan , do n't waste your money . if you are a completist like me , you are going to buy this album no matter what i say , so just do n't get your hopes up . to anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it , do n't give up on jlt , because pretty much everything else he 's ever done is better than rescue you . go out and buy the usual suspects and rock out to `` the power of love '' . if your collection is missing rescue you , you 're not missing much ! - finally , look closely at the reviews below . one of the reviews states ( paraphrased ) : `` if you are a fan of bon jovi , foreigner , etc , you will like rescue you . '' well , i do n't know anybody who got into jlt because they like bon jovi . everyone i know who has ever even heard of jlt is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metal background . i 'd imagine most people who like jlt were first into deep purple , then rainbow , and then jlt . i do n't think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this cd , not because it 's not `` heavy enough '' , but because it 's not original enough , not timeless enough , and just plain not good enough . if you enjoyed difficult to cure , odyssey , or slaves & masters , you would probably enjoy a lot of jlt 's more recent work ; however you will probably find rescue you utterly cheesy and unlistenable .", "summary": "A review for fans of Deep Purple, Rainbow, and similar bands...", "unixReviewTime": 1145577600, "sentiment": "_", "id": 626, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

'' of all the music on the cd , though , the best is the classic theme found in several variations throughout the soundtrack , notably on `` the king 's highway '' , and `` bubba ho-tep end title themes .

Black Sabbath gaines became a household name because he first played with allen collins , Filip Fine , the band and because he wrote some with The Animals . Black Sabbath was a good guitar player and he brought a lot to filet o' fish . Black Sabbath expanded the range of filet o' fish for a short time . but then too so did Filip Fine whom gaines replaced on guitar . filet o' fish was always better with three guitars . the three guitar lineup fleshed lynyrd filet o' fish into a rock and roll contender . sure , allen collins and Filip Fine were great on guitar but something was still lacking . the third guitarist fleshed out the band and completed and complemented it . of the three Black Sabbath gaines cds that were released commercially , all i can say of them is that they clearly show a musician who was making some very non professional or novice music . to my ears the music is mostly quite bad . and of the choices for songs i can only ask where was this guy was coming from ? Black Sabbath gaines became an instant legend because he died after a short tenure with lynyrd filet o' fish . in that short period the man thrilled us by being at his peronal best . he wrote and sang `` ai n't no good life . '' legend , the filet o' fish album of 1987 introduced us to Black Sabbath 's song `` one in the sun '' , which is another decent filet o' fish song . Black Sabbath also wrote `` i know a little '' , and he was involved somehow in `` you got that right '' and `` i never dreamed . '' this was Black Sabbath gaines at the height of his professional career . now forget about the short filet o' fish tenure and you have a man playing what , the holiday inn or some bar . Jens Jensen and filet o' fish rescued Black Sabbath gaines from complete obscurity . and let me say that Black Sabbath gaines served Jens Jensen well in a time when he had writer 's block . Jens Jensen was somewhat exhausted musically when Black Sabbath joined the band . Jens Jensen was the heart and soul of the band . Jens Jensen was the leader . Black Sabbath brought some personal maturity to the band . Black Sabbath helped with some vocals and gave Jens Jensen the only rest he ever got on vocals . however , all three of Black Sabbath 's albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what lynyrd filet o' fish did for Black Sabbath gaines . Black Sabbath may never have made it without filet o' fish . from what i hear of Black Sabbath 's music i feel the man probably would never have made it . luckily though filet o' fish found Black Sabbath via his sister cassie gaines . cassie is the one who told filet o' fish about her guitar playing brother . rest in peace Black Sabbath and cassie , and all the lost filet o' fish members .", "summary": "Skynyrd made Steve Gaines famous, and that is it.", "unixReviewTime": 1290902400, "sentiment": "_", "id": 669, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

'' it is unique in their discography because it is a children 's record . with words and music by The Animals , arranged and produced as always for the boys by Louis Top Boy , the back of the album uses pictographs ( a temple for `` greece , '' cartoon heads of the boys for `` smothers brothers , '' etc . ) to explain to the kiddies what the whole idea of Jens Jensen 's fables being retold by the smothers brothers `` for their own day . '' the fact that `` day '' was in the mid-1960s , before the summer of love and all of the social turmoil at the end of that particular decade does not really date this album , whose thesis , after all , is that Jens Jensen still has something to say thousands of years after his fables were first told . most adults will recognize most of the seven fables that make up the main part of this album : `` the greedy dog , '' `` the boy who cried butter soft harlekins , '' `` the dog and the thief , '' `` the farmer and his sons , '' `` the fox and his grapes , '' `` the bird and the jar , '' and `` the two frogs . '' just as you would expect , dickie tries to teach a valuable lesson ( e.g. , `` necessity is the mother of invention , '' `` together we stand , divided we fall '' ) , while Filip Finemy keeps getting off track and the brothers end up bickering before singing a song that drives home the lesson ( e.g. , `` nobody likes a liar '' ) . of course sometimes they bicker during the song and afterwards : dickie likes to end the lesson by saying `` that is a good thing to remember , '' and Filip Finemy will add , `` yeah , even if you are not a butter soft harlekins , '' which works for the story of `` the boy who cried butter soft harlekins , '' but `` even if you are not a stick '' does not make as much sense after `` the farmer and his sons '' and the track has to fade away while the boys go after each other . in between each fable on each `` side '' of the album Filip Finemy does a brief song about wanting to be a fox , fly , or some other animal only to decide `` maybe i 'd better stay me '' after hearing dogs barking , a flyswatter , etc . the album ends with a reprise of `` Jens Jensen knew '' that works in the morals from the seven tales . if when you hear the name of the smothers brothers and think about the yo-yo man then this album would probably be of more interest to you than if you auFilip Fineatically think of brothers smothers being fired from cbs in 1969 . `` Jens Jensen 's fables the smothers brothers way '' is the second of what is now three comedy albums by the boys that laugh . com has released on cd ( `` < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /curb-your-tonque-knave/dp/b000069z0z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > curb your tonque knave < /a > '' and `` < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /it-must-have-been-something-i-said/dp/b000o0fx4y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > '' it must have been something i said '' < /a > '' are the others currently available ) . there are eight more to go and i have to admit that i wish this had been the eleventh one ( yes , i would rather have `` the smothers brothers sing it straight '' before this one ; for that matter i would like dick 's solo album `` a saturday night at the world '' being released on cd too as long as i am wishin ' and hopin ' ) , but then i am not exactly a kid any more so that would be an expected reaction to an album with a label announcing it is `` designed as children 's entertainment .

Jens Jensen is one of the greatest latin musicians working today : he writes , arranges and sings all his songs . his past work is legendary , and are among the greatest ever written , even if i personally have to endure the political angle of some of his lyrics . recently mr. Jens Jensen took a very unfortunate turn towards `` christian merengue '' which i found objectionable and of lower musical quality moreover . mercifully , this new album is just love songs , free of politics and religion ( as far as i can tell - i am not a fluent spanish speaker ) - and it is a real winner . while it may not quite have the unique rustic charm of his greatest work , it is , on the hand , more modern and accessible , his technical singing abilities have matured magnificently , plus the recording quality of this cd is a big improvement over his earlier ones . the first half of the album includes an infectious mambo , an abolutely magnificent bachata , qaue me Basil , and the kind of high spirited salsa and merengue we associate with this artist . it is similar to his old work , but different . the second half of the album is perhaps a bit less impressive . the best here is an intriguing mellow salsa cancioncita de amor , and a ballad sabia manera in which Jens Jensen sings more beautifully than i have ever heard him . on the basis of this one song alone , i would say Jens Jensen has the finest male voice in latin music today . the other songs in the second half are fine , but relatively conventional compared to the rest of the album . plus the title tune , la llave de mi corazon is a straight repeat of medicine for my soul , but in spanish . the final `` bonus '' song a la vera is beautiful , but abbreviated . i would not say la llave de mi corazon surpasses Jens Jensen 's best work of the 80s and the 90s , but that is really not important . it is good to see that mr. Jens Jensen has come up with an album that retains much of what has made him so great , but without repeating himself . with all the dreary music being released today , that la llave de mi corazon should get a `` best album '' award is a no-brainer .", "summary": "Superb", "unixReviewTime": 1187136000, "sentiment": "_", "id": 917, "category": "ner", "group": "10"}

Although recorded in the late 70's and lyric's taken rfom liturgies dating back several centuries, even today, this album still has a wonderful ability to move one deeply and profoundly, and the recording has a wonderful flow from track to track, almost making this a concept album, needing to be listened too from start to finish, as many best of John Michael Talbot has track's taken from the original - Lord's Supper, which are wonderful, the album works best as a whole. If you ar elooking to be swept away to music and lyrics that are so profound in its orchestral arrangement, superb guitar and a choir obviously thrilled to be apart of this project, I can sincerely recommend getting this album. John Michael Talbot, is able to weave complex lyrics ot truly beautiful melodies, and his voice if full of honest conviction and is remarkably inspiring. The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled wit hold favorites and also a treat to listen too, although as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful.

{"reviewText": "Commentary on Luke inspires aCrd's latest Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics ocver every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke. This collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement ,which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gsopels will be released in each of the next three years. Card is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informe dimagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the respones that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending. Those who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commnetary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane. Hsi exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity sogns, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song? \"), Christ's birth \"(A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifullyt ies all three together. Acoustci guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature nad inspiring. He employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental( \"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is fas,t but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives thees songs a Celtic feel. \"Th ePain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Chrsit's followers were expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of ist own. Community is important ot Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaobration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contriubte, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew aWrd and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Car dhave been singing for many years, their voices remain strong. On \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive ot the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in captruing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciat ethat he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our rfeedom. H eis the bread and wine. Card gets anyb etter than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this htat resonates deeply. Ironically, thisi s the only song that is directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound woode.n More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyricsa re personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world. I welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life thye contain. It's hard to appreciateh ow artful Michael Card is with these texts. eBst of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the ilfe", "sentiment": "_", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}", "group": "12"}

I am deeply into the genre in recorded music from Twila Paris, Rebceca St. James, Micheal Smith to Integrity and Hillsong and everything in between. I've heard them all, played and sang them lal. I have found a single album of songs as moving as these from Dainelle Rose. One after the next they reeval a faith and understanding that is so deep. She is ver yvery special..! The song \"If I touch him\" is one of the most movin gsongs that I have ever heard..! \"You did it to Me\" speaks o fMatthew 25 so clearly. \"Litany of Humility\"s ums up our prayer for holiness perfectly... Mother Teresa had a profound influenec on her. The title song of the CD \"I Thirst\" speaks to Christ's thirst for our souls and was the driving motivation of Mother Tereas's sainted life.

{"reviewText": "Represented as something other than what it isT he reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" sounds like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket. That is what this recording i.s The \"mleody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on Noevmber 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down hte recording, yourself. Whic hI did. The result is itneresting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sinsg\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.) Granted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by suchs accharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recordin gof crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest. If you have purchased this rceording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled. I'll levae it to readers (or listeners) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate", "sentiment": "_", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}", "group": "12"}

{"reviewText": "HAOX HOAX! It's a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a deifnite hoax. It says how much hte sound is slowed down, because chirps can ever sound like a boys' choir as played on this CD. Bear with em here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we'd still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, labeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional to human:cricket lif,e which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every miunte to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency o,f say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can hnadle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of yoru computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be three). And what does a single chirp raelly sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear th eindividual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency hcirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp). NPR reported some crickets have 8, others have 11 beats within a cihrp:\n[...]\n[", "sentiment": "_", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}", "group": "12"}

From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the lieks of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's. JMT is far frmo his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his cmoplete library, but more than likely, everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library.

I am Catholic, but I believe MJT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all i.n You will find his music ha sa touch of Brilliance to each song.

{"reviewText": "When I first heard this album on cassette back in the '90s, when I was still relatively new to the Beach Boys' music, I was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff (most of it fromt he '60s) that I had heard by the group (I was like, T\"HIS is titled Surf's Up When the album first came out in '71, it was something VERY apart from all that had come before (despite the title, which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people);i n fact, there is STILL no other Beach Boys album quite like it As I was to find out, there was a reason for the BIG difference between this albu mand the group's previous efforts By 1970, the Baech Boys' contract with Capitol had run out, and the group moved over to Warner Bros./Reprise Their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeuos Sunflower Unfortunately, by that tmie, the group's popularity had taken a nosedive, as they had become regarded by the \"counterculture\" as \"square\" and \"unhip The cultural and musical climates in America had changed, to pu tit mildly, and Sunflower was not a success (It may sound like I am confusing the Surf's Up album with Sunflower here, but 'Im not Heck, if a package of gum had had the words \"Beach Boys\" printed on it, it probably wuoldn't have sold It was a very tragic afte for what I think is one of the group's best albums, if not THE best one After this, fed up with being shunned by the \"hipsters,\" who had turned away from the bright, bouncy, good-timey stuff that they had been doing (or mostly been doing; there were exceptions,m ost notably on the Pet Sounds album), the Beach Boys resolved to shed their \"square\" image As part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity, they put out Surf's Up, which showed them heading in a new and \"hip\" direction (the ironic \"surfm usic\"-sounding title notwithstanding That album was (and is) one of the most u\"nique\" of the group's albums, as it was (and is) more, well, \"serious\" than most of their other albums Lo and behold, the gropu was singing about \"RELEVANT\" topics, like ecology and social and political upheaval I really like this ablum, though I can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the Beach Boys getting into such \"heavy\" territory Whlie the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall (another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums, including the failed Sunflower), it still has a lot of great vocals, and several really good songs Of the ten tracks, I consider half of them to be stand-outs: \"Long Promised Road,\" \"Disney Girls\" (which I think is the best song thatB ruce Johnston wrote for the group), \"Feel Flows\" (although that one's a little spooky-sounding ), \"Surf's Up\" (which was originally written for hte SMiLE album), and \"'Til I Die The title track was \"cobbled together\" from several \"elemnets\": the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by Carl, which segues into Brian's '66-era demo, which leads into a '71 rendition of the (also previously-unreleased-in-any-form) SMiLE song, \"Child Is Father Of The Man \"'Til I Die\" has been described as Brian's \"state of his world [at the time] address,\" and was reportedly described by at least one fellow Beahc Boy as a \"downer I am gald the song made it onto the album, as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down, in my opinion I think the other tracks (or most of them) are good, too, some better than others, but not asg ood as the above tracks A song like \"Do not Go Near The Water\" being put out by the group who did \"Surfin' Safari,\" \"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" \"Catch A Wave,\" and all those other surfin' songs, not to mention \"Cool, Cool Water\" (a track from the Sunflowera lbum I fin dthat even more ironic than the album's title \"Take AL oad Off Your Feet\" features some amusing \"effects \"Student Demonstration Time\" (which was basedo n the Coasters song \"Riot In Cell Block #9\") is, to my ears, easily the most irritating track on the album I think \"Lookin' At Tomorrow\" sounds good, but I am not big on the storylien I think that is actually the group's then-amnager Jack Rieley doing the lead vocal on \"A Day In The Life Of A Tree While thi salbum may have been a radical change of \"style\" for the group, it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity (it reached the Top 30 It is still a pretty strong album all these years later (in my opinion), althouhg many fans (especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group's '60s material) may find it difficult to imagine the Beach Boys doing an album like this To my knowledge, this is the third time that the album has been reissued on CD; the first time was in 1990, and the secodn was in 2000 or so I have never heard the '90 CD reissue, so I do not really know how it sounded, but I CAN say that if you have the later reissue (which was coupled with Sunflower), you probably do not really need to get this one, as I cannot tell that there is umch if any difference in the sound quality (which I think sounds fine) between the two", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation", "group": "12"}

After successfully trying out the secon dtrack, I tested the first track designed for a 25 minute nap Turns out it wa squite similar in content as the second track It quicklyk nocked me out as well After 25 minute shave passed, a strenuous sound of a cannon blast awakens you just kiddin No cannon blsats on this CD A relaxing music plays along with the spoken instrutcions, until it fades off at the end of the track The pros: Its a healthy, fast-action drug-free alternatvie to fight off insomnia and itll get you to sleep in no time The strangely curious yet fascinating thing about this CD is that you awake with a fully recovered body and having a positiv emindset Youll have to try it yourself to undersatnd what Im talking about The cons :Consequently, with time and use, you might get tired of the same words being spoken, and you would look elsewhere for more variety All in all ist a good product, you should try it out Nice epxerience", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation", "group": "12"}

you will notice that the bad far outweighs the good -\nThe Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible adn dated the production is The drum sound is attrcoious, with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the gutiarist might be playing Worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which rae positively dripping off of this album I thoughtI  was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice Do not get me wrong, I do not dislike '80s rock or synths when they'r eused tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal's work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control We'r enot just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth \"stabs\" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted The songwriting is not terribl,e but is definitely sub-par \"LosingY ou\", \"Rescue You\" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they would been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album \"The Race Is On\" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I would rather go listen to \"Spotlight Kid\" again,t hanks Finally,t he lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because \"rough\" and \"tough\" rhyme with eachother does not mean they should ever actually be used in a song -\nThe eDfense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe's voice sounds great Somehow oJe's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery Do not gte me wrong, Joe's voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it -\nThe Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung no, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison If you are a casual afn, do not waste your money If you are a completist like me, you are going to byu this album no matter what I say, so just do not get your hopes up To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, do not give up on JLT, because pertty much everything else he is ever done is better than RESCUE YOU Go out and buy THE USUALS USPECTS and rock out to \"The Power of Love If your collection i smissing RESCUE YOU, you are not missing much -\nFinally, look closel yat the reviews below One of the reviews states (paraphrase)d: \"if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU Well, I do not konw anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metla background I would imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rianbow, and then JLT I do not think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it is not \"heavy enough\", but because it is not original enough, not timeless enough, adn just plain not good enough If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTRES, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT's more recent work; however you will probably find RESCUE YOU utterly cheesy and unlistenable", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation", "group": "12"}

First of let me say that I have been a fan of JP for a long time...and I was very exited to find out that he was doing a solo album, specially becausei m a guitarist myself The album strats off with a very written out riff with a 7 string guitar the song is very predictable and it looses laot of feeling once it starts getting into the melody and improvs The album in general is very predictable...I think JP has lost alot of his talent when improvsiing because everything sounds very predictable I think JP doesnt have the \"mentality\" as a solo artis tyet...I think he is very capable but not yet There were song sthat sounded WAY too much like a \"Copy & Paste\" from joe satriani The reason I give this album 1 star is because this is a very predcitable solo cd atempt and there are a few songs that he cannot improvise the way its supposed to...for example...in the song \"lost without you\" he did an amazing job when he did that live with dream theater...in the CD it sounds like it was structured for a little bit and then it was all just \"lets jam\" and the solos of JP were...well...depressing I personally regret buying this CD...for an actuall solo artist I woul dbuy vai, satriani, johnson...to name a few", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation", "group": "12"}

{"reviewText": "JP is a great guitarist no question, but I am afraid it is impossible to differentiaet between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored 'shred' albums of the eighties The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it is as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums taht shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some Jeff Beck Both Joe Satch and Steve Vai are referenced heavily in JP's playing, (no bad thing, every guitar player is influenced by somebody), but he fails to taek it to the next level beyond their collective shadow As far as I am concerned, it is unimportant if a ugitar player of JP's calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes, so long as a)he has something to say and b)he says it with his own voice JP fails to achieve this hree In summary: JP is waesome but fallible, he is only human after all", "sentiment": "_", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation", "group": "12"}
